      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Apply to remove personal details from Companies House public documents</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to ask for personal details such as a home address to be removed from publicly available documents on the Companies House register.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can do this if the home address has been used as a correspondence address, or as a company's former registered office address.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      If the home address is being used as the company's current registered office address, you must submit a filing to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-a-registered-office-address-ad01">update the registered office address</a> first.
      </div>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">As part of this service, you'll need to tell us which documents you want us to remove the home address from. It costs £XX for each document you select.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Find out which documents contain the home address by searching for the company on the <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/">Companies House register</a> and checking its filing history.</p> 

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>To use this service, you'll need:</strong></p>


      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to sign in to or create a Companies House account</li>
        <li>the company number</li>
        <li>the applicant’s name, date of birth and any previous names used on the Companies House register</li>
        <li>the home address you want to remove</li>
        <li>an email address we can contact if we need more information</li>
        <li>a credit or debit card</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the home address is being used as someone's correspondence address, you'll also need to provide an address to replace it.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">It takes around 10 minutes to complete this application.</p>

      {{ govukButton({

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Other ways to remove your personal information</h2>
